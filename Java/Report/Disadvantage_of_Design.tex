\section{Disadvantage of Design}
\subsection{File IO}
Beacuse we use java.IO.File to access our assets, it is nearly impoosible to package the whole game as a file.
A proper way to load image from .jar file is to use getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(). However, since the utility is design to load state by
all file name, it is not likely possible to do so.
\subsection{Design limit}
We us java AWT as our GUI engine, and because it is quite old package, some of our design is limited by its ability.
